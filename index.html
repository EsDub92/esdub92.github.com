  <h1>GitHub Respository 101</h1>
  <p>This is a beginner's guide to deploying a webiste using <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In GitHub, code is stored in a repository, or repo. You can think of it as a special folder that lives online. GitHub hosts that folder so that it is accessible to you and your teammates from anywhere in the world.</p>
  <br>
  <p>GitHub just displays the code like any other text. GitHub Pages essentially connects your repository to a unique URL so that, when you go to that URL – say <em>username.github.com</em> – in your browser, you’ll find your website displayed.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Creating A Page</h2>
  <br>
  <p>You should be redirected to the repository page, which shows an empty repository. It’s time to add a file! On that page, click the “creating a new file” link.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Changes to your repository are called <em>commits</em>. You can imagine each commit as a snapshot of your repository at different times.</p>
  <p>Commits usually start with a verb describing changes made to the repository, such as "Create index.html".</p>
